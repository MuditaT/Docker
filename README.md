# Docker
Docker is an open-source project which aims to automate the deployment of applications inside portable containers that are independent of hardware, host operating system, and language. We have created a Docker Monitoring Tool with new features like container level monitoring, alerts for any violation of container metrics, store historical data for generating graphs and to make it available to user to reference network statistics and resource usage history of containers. Also, to introduce additional container management features such as running, stopping, killing containers and to develop a rich modified UI for display.
